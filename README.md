# PHP-FPM, NGINX, Environment

This environment is based on the [tutorial provided by Pascal Landau](https://www.pascallandau.com/blog/php-php-fpm-and-nginx-on-docker-in-windows-10/
).

---

It is a bare bones quick setup. 
1. Replace the contents of the app directory with your app.
2. Save your nginx configuration files in the nginx-server/conf.d
3. Make any modifications you need to docker-compose.yml for adding volumes.

- TODO : add directions...
